# responsive-portfolio

This was the second homework in the course where I had to build a responsive portfolio using bootstrap. 

# Requirements

I was able to add my own touch of creativeness to the portfolio, the only requirement was to use bootstrap and make it responsive.

# process

The first thing was creating the html to format how I wanted my portfolio, then I linked bootstrap links to it to add responsiveness and things like the navigation bar and the the contact form. I used very minimal css.

# results

Being responsive means my portfolio will adjust in size to the users screen, and it does just that.
